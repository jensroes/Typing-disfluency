\begin{itemize}
	\item How do we deal with the heavy tail statistically without losing information, trimming data, imposing pause thresholds?
	\item \dots and extract pause frequencies in a principled way?
%	\item ex-Gaussian \parencite{chukharev2014pauses}
	\item Mixture of log-normals \parencite{almond2012preliminary,baaijen2012keystroke}
	\item[$\rightarrow$] More than one underlying data-generating process; i.e. normal key transitions and disfluencies.		 
	\item Compared to standard log-normal treatment.
	\item[$\rightarrow$] One underlying data-generating process.
