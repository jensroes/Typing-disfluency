% summary of claim

\begin{frame}{Discussion: summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Evidence against the phrase-as-planning-unit hypothesis \parencite[as in][]{martin2010planning,roeser2019advance,smi99}
		\item Planning conjoined NPs is not obligated by the language production system.
		\item Therefore the NP effect is no evidence that syntax is obligated by the production system.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% why conjoined NPs then if not syntax?

\begin{frame}{Discussion: alternative}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[i.] Linear distance between first two nouns:
		\item preplanning is required in some trials to avoid intra-sentential pausing.
		\item[ii.] Both a syntactic and a word-driven route are available to the planning system:
		\item using the syntactic-route leads to a slowdown in conjoined NPs but not in simple NPs. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


% why do we get this effect in experiment 2?
% effect must be visual

\begin{frame}{Discussion: mixture models}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Both word-driven and syntax-driven planning strategies are available to the production system.
		\item Mixture models allow us to statistically capture that these routes are not used deterministically \dots
		\item but either route is more (or less) likely to be used under certain circumstances \parencite{konopka2014priming}. 
	\end{itemize}
